# Welcome to My DSA Repository ðŸŽ“

## Introduction

This is not a specific project but rather a **collection of lessons** on **Data Structures** and **Algorithms**. Here, I share the algorithms that I believe are the **most optimized** for solving various problems.

Each algorithm and data structure is explained concisely and clearly, with illustrative examples.

## Content

- **Data Structures**: Types of data structures such as Arrays, Linked Lists, Trees, Graphs, etc.
- **Algorithms**: Search algorithms, sorting algorithms, recursion, divide and conquer, etc.
- **Optimization Problems**: Some interesting problems and approaches to solve them using different algorithms.

## Goals

- **Learning and Sharing**: To store my knowledge of DSA.
- **Optimization**: Sharing algorithms that I believe are the most optimized for various problems.

## Thank You!

Thank you for taking the time to visit my repository. I hope these shared insights are helpful to you.

Have a great day! ðŸ˜Š
