# DSA - Data Structures and Algorithms

## Introduction
This repository was created with the goal of practicing and improving skills in algorithms and data structures. Every day, I will strive to complete at least one exercise in algorithms or data structures **using Java**.

## Objectives
- Learn and apply data structures such as: Array, Linked List, Stack, Queue, Tree, Graph, HashMap, etc.
- Solve common algorithm problems: Sorting, Searching, Dynamic Programming, Greedy Algorithms, etc.
- Improve problem-solving and analytical skills.

## How to use
1. Each folder will contain solutions related to a specific topic.
2. Each file will correspond to a problem and its solution using Java.
3. Refer to and try to solve the problems again to gain a deeper understanding of data structures and algorithms.

## Commitment
- **Strive to complete one algorithm problem in Java every day**, not only for practice but also to effectively retain knowledge of algorithms.

## Contact
- If you have any questions or contributions, please open an issue or a pull request.

Thank you for taking the time to read this. Have a great day!
